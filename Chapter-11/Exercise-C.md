# (a)

> The value of an automatic storage class variable persists between various function invocations.

## Ans: False

```md
The value of an ***static*** storage class variable persists between various function invocations.
```

&nbsp;

# (b)

> If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage class variables are treated as static storage class

## Ans: False

```md
If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage class variables are treated as ***Automatic*** storage class
```

&nbsp;

## (c)

> The register storage class variables cannot hold float value

## Ans: True

&nbsp;

## (d)

> If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler will report an error message

## Ans: False

```
If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler ***won't*** report an error message. ***The compiler will treat this as Automatic storage class variable.***
```

## (e)

> If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler will report an error message

## Ans: False

```
If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler ***won't*** report an error message. ***The compiler will treat this as Automatic storage class variable.***
```
