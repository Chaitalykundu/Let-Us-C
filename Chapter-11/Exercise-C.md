# State whether the following statements are True or False

## (a)

> The value of an automatic storage clas variable persists between various function invocations.

## Ans: False

```
The value of an ***static*** storage clas variable persists between various function invocations.
```

&nbsp;

## (b)

> If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage class variables are treated as static storage class

## Ans: False

```
If the CPU registers are not available, the register storage class variables are treated as ***Automatic*** storage class
```

&nbsp;

## (c)

> The register storage class variables cannot hold float value

## Ans: True

&nbsp;

## (d)

> If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler will report an error message

## Ans: False

```
If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler ***won't*** report an error message. ***The compiler will treat this as Automatic storage class variable.***
```

&nbsp;

## (d)

> If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler will report an error message

## Ans: False

```
If we try to use register storage class for a float variable the compiler ***won't*** report an error message. ***The compiler will treat this as Automatic storage class variable.***
```
