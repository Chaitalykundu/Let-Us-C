# (a)

## The three parts of the loop expression in the for loop are

```md
the ___i_______________ expression
the ___t_______________ expression
the ___i_______________ expression
```

> Ans: \
 &emsp;  &emsp; the ***initialization*** expression\
 &emsp;  &emsp; the ***testing*** expression\
 &emsp;  &emsp; the ***incrementation*** expression

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# (b)

## The **break** statement is used tto exit from

```md
    1. An if statement
    2. A for statement
    3. A program
    4. The main() function
```

> **Ans** : (2) A for statement

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# (c)

## A **do-while** loop is useful when we want that the statements within the loop must be executed

```md
    1. Only once
    2. At least once
    3. More than once
    4. None
```

> **Ans** : (2) At least once

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# (d)

## In what sequence the initialization, testing and execution of the body is one in a **do-while** loop

```md
    1. initialization, execution of the body, testing
    2. execution of the body, initialization, testing
    3. initialization, testing, execution of the body
    4. None
```

> **Ans** : (1) initialization, execution of the body, testing

# (e)

## Which of the following is not an infinity Loop

```c
    1.  int i = 1;
        while(1)
        {
            i++;
        }

    2. for(; ;);

    3.  int t=0,f;
        while(t)
        {
          f=1;
        }

    4.  int y, x=0;
        do
        {
            y=x;
        }while(x==0;)
```

> **Ans** :

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# (f)

## Which keyword is used to take the control to the beginning of the loop

> **Ans** : Continue

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# (g)

## How many times the while loop will get executed

```c
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        int j = 1;
        while(j<=255)
        {
            printf("%c %d\n", j,j);
            j++;
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

> **Ans** : 255

# (h)

## Which of the following statements is true for the program

```c
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        int x = 10,  y =100 % 90;
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++);
        if(x!=y)
            printf("x= %d  y= %d\n",x,y);
        return 0;
    }



    1. The printf() function is called 10 times
    2. The program will produce the output x=10, y=10
    3. The ; after the if(x!=y) would not produce an error
    4. The program will not produce any output
    5. The printf() function is called infinity times
```

> **Ans** : (3) The ; after the if(x!=y) would not produce an error

&nbsp;

# (i)

## Which of the following statements is true about a for loop used in a C program

```md
    1. For loop works faster than while loop
    2. All things that can be done using for loop can also be done using while loop
    3. for(; ;) implements an infinite loop
    4. For loop can be used if we want statements in a loop to get executed at least once
    5. for loop works faster than do-while loop
```

> **Ans**\
 &emsp; &emsp; (2) All things that can be done using for loop can also be done using while loop\
 &emsp; &emsp; (3) for(; ;) implements an infinite loop
