# Answer the following

## (a) An Array is a collection of -

```md
1. Different datatypes scattered throughout memory
2. The same datatype scattered throughout memory
3. The same datatype placed next to each other in memory
4. Different datatypes placed next to each other in memory
```

> ### Ans: (3) The same datatype placed next to each other in memory

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (b) Are the following array declarations correct?

```md
    1. int num[5]
    2. int size = 10; b[size];
    3. int c = {0,1,2};
```

> Ans: \
   &emsp;  &emsp; (1) No\
   &emsp;  &emsp; (2) No \
   &emsp;  &emsp; (3) No

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (c) Which element of the array does this expression reference? &emsp; num[4]

> Ans: 5th element

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (d) What is the difference between the 5's in these two expressions?

```md
int num[5];
num[5]=11;

    1. First is particular element and second is type

    2. First is array size and second is particular element

    3. First is particular element and second is array size

    4. Both specify array size
```

> ### Ans: (2) First is array size and second is particular element

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (e) State whether the following statements are true or false

```md
    1. The array int num[26] has twenty-six elements

    2. The expression num[1] designates the first element in the array

    3. It is necessary to initialize the array at the time of declaration

    4. The expression num[27] designates the twenty-eighth element in the array
```

> Ans: \
   &emsp;  &emsp; (1) True\
   &emsp;  &emsp; (2) False \
   &emsp;  &emsp; (3) False \
   &emsp;  &emsp; (4) True

&nbsp;

## (f) What will happen if you try to put so many values into an array when you initialize it that the size of the array is exceeded

```md
    1. Nothing
    2. Possible system malfunction
    3. Error message from the compiler
    4. Other data may be overwritten
```

> ### Ans: (4) Other data may be overwritten

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (g) What will happen if you try to put too few elements in an array when you initialize it

```md
    1. Nothing
    2. Possible system malfunction
    3. Error message from the compiler
    4. Unused elements will be filled with 0's or garbage
```

> ### Ans: (4) Unused elements will be filled with 0's or garbage

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (h) What will happen if you assign a value to an element of an array whose subscript exceeds the size of the memory

```md
    1. The element will be set to 0
    2. Nothing. It's done all the time
    3. Other data may be overwritten
    4. Error message from the compiler
```

> ### Ans: (4) Error message from the compiler

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (i) When you pass an array as an argument to a function, what actually gets passed

```md
    1. Address of the array
    2. Values of the elements of the array
    3. Address of the first element of the array
    4. Number of elements of the array
```

> ### Ans: (3) Address of the first element of the array

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (j) If you don't initialize a static array, what will be the element set to

```md
    1. 0
    2. An undetermined value
    3. A floating point number
    4. the character constant '\0'
```

> ### Ans: (1) 0

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## (k) If int s[5] is a 1-D array of integer, which of the following refers to the third element in the array

```md
    1. *( s + 2 )
    2. *( s + 3 )
    3. s + 3
    4. s + 2
```

> ### Ans: (1) *( s + 2 )
